# TechMateCoal mines are highly dangerous environments due to the presence of toxic gases, low oxygen levels, and high moisture, which can lead to serious accidents and loss of life.
This project presents a Coal Mine Safety Rover that continuously monitors critical environmental parameters and provides real-time safety alerts.
The rover is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, which collects data from multiple sensors and transmits it wirelessly to a mobile application via Bluetooth. The system helps in early detection of hazardous conditions, improving miner safety and reducing risks.s-
